## 🚀 About Me
🕵️‍♀️ I’m Nhi Pham (just call me Nina), a software developer from Vietnam 🇻🇳, now living in Passau, Germany 🇩🇪.
Currently, I’m studying for an M.Sc. in Computer Science at Universität Passau (2025–2027).

At CyberLogitec Vietnam, I worked as a **Full-stack JavaScript Developer** on large-scale enterprise systems, including a container management platform for Ocean Network Express (ONE), the world’s 6th largest shipping carrier.

Previously, as a Front-end Developer at DigiBird Co., I led a small team delivering client-facing apps, and I’ve also completed freelance projects in web development.

In my spare time, I like building side projects. One example is [Formularizer](https://formularizer.com/home), an AI assistant for Excel & Google Sheets where I took responsibility for the frontend development, helping the product reach **15k+ users**.
